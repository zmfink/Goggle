Alabama  @#$% is a state located in the southeastern region of the States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama ranks 30th in total land area and ranks second in the size of its inland waterways. The state ranks 23rd in population with 4.7 million residents in 2009.()

From the Civil War until War II, Alabama, like many Southern states, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, white rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s, while urban interests and Americans were under-represented.() Following World War II, Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from agriculture to diversified interests in heavy manufacturing, mineral extraction, education, and technology.  In addition, the establishment or expansion of multiple military installations, primarily those of the Army and Air Force, added to state jobs.

Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state bird. Alabama is also known as the "Heart of Dixie". The state tree is the Pine, the state flower is the Camellia. The capital of Alabama is Montgomery.  The largest city by population is Birmingham. The largest city by total land area is Huntsville. The oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists.

History



Etymology
The (people), a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Rivers on the upper reaches of the River,() served as the etymological source of the names of the river and state. In the language, the word for an Alabama person is Albaamo (or variously Albaama or Alb&#224;amo in different dialects; the plural form "Alabama persons" is Albaamaha).() The word Alabama is believed to have originated from the language() and was later adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name.()  The spelling of the word varies significantly between sources.(  The first usage appears in three accounts of the de Soto expedition of 1540 with Garcilasso de la Vega using Alibamo, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu, respectively.(  As early as 1702, the tribe was known to the French as Alibamon with French maps identifying the river as Rivi&#232;re des Alibamons.(  Other spellings of the appellation have included Alibamu, Alabamo, Albama, Alebamon, Alibama, Alibamou, Alabamu, and Allibamou.(()()(The use of state names derived from Native American languages is common; an estimated 27 states have names of Native American origin. )

Although the origin of Alabama could be discerned, sources disagree on its meaning. An 1842 article in the Jacksonville Republican originated the idea that the meaning was "Here We Rest."( This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Beaufort Meek.(  Experts in the languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation.((  Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw alba (meaning "plants" or "weeds") and amo (meaning "to cut", "to trim", or "to gather").((()  The meaning may have been "clearers of the thicket"( or "herb gatherers"(() which may refer to clearing of land for cultivation( or to collecting medicinal plants.(

Indigenous peoples, early history
File:Cheaha Lake in the Fall.jpg|thumb|right|Cheaha, Alabama's highest point

peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization. Trade with the Northeast via the River began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 BC&#8211;AD 700) and continued until European contact.() The agrarian culture covered most of the state from AD 1000 to 1600, with one of its major centers being at the Archaeological Site in Alabama.()() Analysis of artifacts recovered from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the Ceremonial Complex (SECC).() Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture, but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.()

Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were  Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee, and the Muskogean-speaking Alabama (Alibamu), Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Koasati, and Mobile.()

European settlement
The French founded the first European settlement in the region at Old Mobile, in 1702.() The area was French from 1702 to 1763; part of British Florida from 1763 to 1780. Thomas Bassett was the first British settler in the state. He settled near what is now River in Washington County.() Alabama became part of Spanish West Florida from 1780 to 1810; part of the independent of West Florida for a short time (90 days); annexed by the U.S. and added to the of Orleans (1810); and, finally, added to the Territory in 1812. Throughout these later developments, however, the Spanish had kept a nominal (although largely ignored) governmental presence in the region, based out of Mobile. When Jackson's forces occupied Mobile in 1814 &#8212;while preparing for the of New Orleans &#8212;he demonstrated the United States' facto authority over the region, effectively ending Spanish governance (though not its claim), while gaining an unencumbered passage to the gulf.()

The area making up today's northern and central Alabama, known as the lands, had been claimed by the of Georgia after 1763. Following the Revolutionary War, it remained a part of the state of Georgia &#8212;although heavily disputed. Conflicting claims to the area were held, first by several Native American tribes (most notably the Chickamauga-Cherokee and Yazoo), by other states (e.g. Carolina); and by the US federal government; Britain and Spain. In 1802, the region was joined to the Territory.  Individual statehood was delayed, however, by the territory's lack of a coastline.

Statehood, Civil War and Reconstruction

Alabama became the twenty-second state &#8212;admitted to the Union in 1819.  Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men. Settlers rapidly arrived to take advantage of the fertile soil. Southeastern planters and traders from the South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations expanded. The economy of the central "Black Belt" (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners' wealth grew largely from slave labor.( The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became farmers. The 1860 census records show that enslaved Africans comprised 45% of the state's total population of 964,201. There were only 2,690 free persons of color living in Alabama at the time.

From 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa served as the capital of Alabama. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced that it had voted to remove the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847. In time, a Capitol building was erected under the direction of a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania architect. The original structure burnt down in 1849 but was rebuilt in 1851 following the original plans.(Montgomery: History - Early Days in Montgomery, Lafayette's Visit a Local Highlight)

On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its secession from the Union and joined the States of America. While few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the Civil War. Alabama's slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865.() During Reconstruction, the new state legislators created a public school system for the first time, as well as establishing some welfare institutions to help its people.  Alabama was officially restored to the Union in 1868.

After the Civil War, the state was still chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton.  Planters resisted working with free labor during Reconstruction and sought to re-establish controls over freedmen. In the early years the Klux Klan had numerous independent chapters in Alabama that attacked freedmen and other Republicans.  After it was suppressed, insurgent whites organized paramilitary groups, such as the Red Shirts and League, that acted more openly to suppress black voting.  Regaining power by the late 1870s, in the last decade of the 19th century, white Democrats passed electoral laws disfranchise most blacks and many poor whites.(J. Morgan Kousser.The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974) Having regained power in the state legislature, Democrats passed Crow laws, including segregation in public facilities, to restore white supremacy in the society.

In 1875, the state passed the Amendment, to prohibit public money from being used to finance Catholic schools.()

The new 1901 of Alabama effectively disfranchised African Americans and many poor whites through voting restrictions, including literacy requirements. While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to support these legislative efforts, the new restrictions resulted in disfranchising poor whites as well, due mostly to imposition of a cumulative tax.

In 1900, 14 Black Belt counties had more than 79,000 voters on the rolls. By June 1, 1903, the number of  registered voters had dropped to 1,081. In 1900, Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903, only 2,980 had qualified to register, although at least 74,000 black voters were literate.(

By 1941, a total of more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 whites to 520,000 blacks.(Glenn Feldman. The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.) Nearly all African Americans lost the ability to vote.

The disfranchisement was ended  by African Americans' leading the Rights Movement and gaining Federal legislation in the mid-1960s to protect their voting and civil rights.  The Rights Act of 1965 also protected the suffrage of poor whites.

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans in the segregated state, but did not relieve them of paying taxes.() Continued racial discrimination, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities. They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the Great Migration to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities. The population growth rate in Alabama (see "Historical Populations" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920, reflecting the effect of emigration.

At the same time, many rural whites and blacks migrated to the city of Birmingham for work in new industrial jobs. It experienced such rapid growth that it was nicknamed "The Magic City".  By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the U.S. and held more than 30% of the population of the state. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of the economy.()

Industrial development related to the demands of War II brought prosperity.( Cotton faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base. In the 1960s under Governor Wallace, many whites in the state opposed federal integration efforts in schools and public facilities.

1960&#8211;present
Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham.

One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services.  Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, "A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature."(

African Americans were presumed partial to Republicans for historical reasons, but they were disfranchised. White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction. These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with white voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefs.

During the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans achieved a protection of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national Rights Act of 1964,() and the Rights Act of 1965. jure segregation ended in the states as Crow laws were invalidated or repealed.()

Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to properly redistrict by population both the House and Senate of the state legislature. In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature implemented the Alabama constitution's provision for periodic redistricting based on population.  This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years.(

After 1972, the state's white voters shifted much of their support to Republican candidates in presidential elections (as also occurred in neighboring southern states). Since 1990 the majority of whites in the state have voted increasingly Republican in state elections.  In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.()

Geography

Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with  of total area: 3.19% of the area is water, making Alabama twenty-third in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States.()  About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the River and the Gulf of Mexico. The Alabama region is mostly mountainous, with the River cutting a large valley creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.()

The states bordering Alabama are Tennessee to the north; Georgia to the east; Florida to the south; and Mississippi to the west. Alabama has coastline at the of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state.(  Alabama ranges in elevation from sea level() at Bay to over 1,800 feet (550 m) in the Mountains in the northeast. The highest point is Cheaha,( at a height of .()  Alabama's land consists of  of forest or 67% of total land area.(Alabama Forest Owner's Guide to Information Resources, Introduction, Alabamaforests.org)  Suburban Baldwin County, along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area.()

Areas in Alabama administered by the Park Service include Bend National Military Park near Alexander City; River Canyon National Preserve near Fort Payne; Cave National Monument in Bridgeport; Airmen National Historic Site in Tuskegee; and Institute National Historic Site near Tuskegee.() Additionally, Alabama has four National Forests: Conecuh, Talladega, Tuskegee, and William B. Bankhead.()  Alabama also contains the Trace Parkway, the To Montgomery National Historic Trail, and the Trail Of Tears National Historic Trail.  A notable natural wonder in Alabama is "Natural Bridge" rock, the longest bridge east of the Rockies, located just south of Haleyville.

A -wide meteorite impact crater is located in Elmore County, just north of Montgomery. This is the crater, which is the site of "Alabama's greatest natural disaster".("Wetumpka Impact Crater" Wetumpka Public Library. Retrieved August 21, 2007.)  A -wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago.( The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme ("star-wound") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface.("The Wetumpka Astrobleme" by John C. Hall, Alabama Heritage, Fall 1996, Number 42.) In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as an internationally recognized impact crater.(

Climate


The state is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) under the Koppen Climate Classification.() The average annual temperature is 64 &#176;F (18 &#176;C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.()  Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of  of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.(

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the United States, with high temperatures averaging over  throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to storms and even hurricanes. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.

File:Alabama winter 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Though winters in the state are usually mild, nightly freezing occurs frequently in the Alabama region. This is shown in this picture taken at the Old State Bank in Decatur during early January.

South Alabama reports many thunderstorms. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail &#8211; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks seventh in the number of deaths from lightning and ninth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.(Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 1990&#8211;2003. NLSI. Retrieved May 8, 2007.)

Alabama, along with Kansas, has the most reported EF5 tornadoes of any state &#8211; according to statistics from the Climatic Data Center for the period January 1, 1950, to October 31, 2006.(Fujita scale. Tornadoproject.com. Retrieved September 3, 2007.) Several long &#8211; tracked F5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state, even surpassing Texas which has a much larger area within Alley.  The state suffered damage in the Outbreak of April 1974, and the 25&#8211;28, 2011 tornado outbreak.

The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state.  Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season. The northern part of the state &#8212; along the Tennessee Valley &#8212; is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as Alley, as distinct from the Alley of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the United States, with average January low temperatures around  in Mobile and around  in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years.  Historic snowfall events include Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm and the Storm of the Century.  The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is  per year.  In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

Demographics

footnote  Sources: 1910-2010()



The States Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2008, estimated Alabama's population at 4,661,900,() which represents an increase of 214,545, or 4.8%, since the last census in 2000.() This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 people (that is 502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 people into the state.( Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people.(  The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were illegal immigrants (24,000).

The of population of Alabama is located in Chilton County, outside of the town of Jemison.()

Race and ancestry
According to the U.S. Census, Alabama had a population of 4,779,736. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 68.5% White (67.0% Non-Hispanic White Alone), 26.2% Black or African American, 0.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.1% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 2.0% from Some Other Race, and 1.5% from Two or More Races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 3.9% of the population.()

The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are: American (26.2%), English (23.6%), Irish (7.7%), German (5.7%), and Scots-Irish (2.0%).()()()  In the 2000 Census, 621,080 people claimed to be of "American ancestry", most them are of overwhelmingly English extraction, however most English Americans identify simply as having ethnicity because their roots have been in North America as long as the early 1600s. Demographers estimate that roughly 23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry.()(Reynolds Farley, 'The New Census Question about Ancestry: What Did It Tell Us?', Demography, Vol. 28, No. 3 (August 1991), pp. 414, 421.)(Stanley Lieberson and Lawrence Santi, 'The Use of Nativity Data to Estimate Ethnic Characteristics and Patterns', Social Science Research, Vol. 14, No. 1 (1985), pp. 44-6.)(Stanley Lieberson and Mary C. Waters, 'Ethnic Groups in Flux: The Changing Ethnic Responses of American Whites', Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 487, No. 79 (September 1986), pp. 82&#8211;86.)  There are also many more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than are self-reported.(

In 1984, under the Davis&#8211;Strong Act, Alabama established a state Indian Commission and officially recognized seven American Indian tribes, including the Echota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama, which is a 501 (c3) group. It is made up of descendants of the Chickamauga Cherokee and others who managed to evade Removal in the 1830s. Working with University, the tribe has begun a revival of the language.

Religion
Alabama is located in the middle of the Belt. A majority of people in Alabama today identify as Protestant. As of 2000, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are Protestant, Protestant, and Catholic.

Law and government

State government


The foundational document for Alabama's government is the Constitution, which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the Constitution.()()  There is a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.() This movement is based upon the fact that Alabama's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands. Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism.

Alabama is divided into three equal branches:
The branch is the Legislature, a bicameral assembly composed of the House of Representatives, with 105 members, and the Senate, with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation.

The branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the of Alabama. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the General of Alabama, the Secretary of State, the Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries, the State Treasurer, and the Auditor of Alabama.

The branch is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The highest court is the Court of Alabama.

Taxes
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent personal income tax, depending upon the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are not allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, but can deduct federal Social Security and Medicare taxes.

The state's general sales tax rate is 4%.(Comparison of State and Local Retail Sales Taxes, July 2004 Retrieved on May 25, 2007.) The collection rate could be substantially higher, depending upon additional city and county sales taxes. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay a 11% tax on a meal. Sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide. Alabama is also one of the few remaining states that levies a tax on food and medicine. Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the nation's very highest.() Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line.( Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.(

The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.()  taxes are the lowest in the United States. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.

Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670 million.

Local and county government


Alabama has 67 counties. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the County Commission, which usually also has executive authority in the county. Because of the restraints placed in the Constitution, all but seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no rule. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.

Alabama is an beverage control state; the government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. However, counties can declare themselves "dry"; the state does not sell alcohol in those areas.

Politics



The current governor of the state is Republican Robert Bentley. The lieutenant governor is Republican Ivey. The Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Democrat Bell Cobb. The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

During Reconstruction following the Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Military District under General John Pope. In 1874, the political coalition known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African American vote.

After 1890, a coalition of whites passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise black residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor whites, however. By 1941 more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000, although the impact was greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state. The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972.

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the American Civil Rights Movement, when majority whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Wallace, the state's only four-term governor, was a  controversial figure. Only with the passage of the Federal Rights Act of 1964( and Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain suffrage and other civil rights.

In 2007, the Legislature passed, and Republican Governor Riley signed, a resolution expressing "profound regret" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the State Capitol, which housed Congress of the States of America.()

State elections
With the disfranchisement of African Americans, the state became part of the "South", a one-party system in which the Democratic Party became essentially the only political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100 years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally only token Republican challengers running in the General Election.

Developments in the 1986 Democratic primary election led to the election of the first Republican Governor in more than 100 years and started Republicans on the road to political dominance in the state.  One million voters cast ballots in the 1986 Democratic primary. The then-incumbent Lieutenant Governor, Baxley, lost the Democratic nomination for Governor by approximately 8,000 votes to then fellow Democratic Attorney General Graddick. The state Democratic party's five-member election contest committee invalidated the primary election result claiming that thousands of Republicans had "illegally" voted in the Democratic primary for Graddick and as a result they removed Graddick from the ballot.  The Democratic Party then placed Baxley's name on the ballot as the Democratic candidate instead of Graddick. The voters of the state revolted at what they perceived as disenfranchisement of their right to vote and elected the Republican challenger Hunt as Governor.(Stovall, Cotter, &amp; Fisher, Alabama Political Almanac, p. 260, 1995) Hunt had been nominated in a statewide Republican primary that had 28,000 participants compared to the 1,000,000 plus of the Democratic primary.  That November Hunt became the first Republican Governor elected in Alabama since Reconstruction when he won 57% of the vote statewide against Baxley.

Since 1986, Republicans have won six of the seven Governors elections and become increasingly competitive in Alabama politics at many levels.   They currently control both seats in the U.S. Senate and six out of the state's seven congressional seats.

Republicans hold all nine seats on the Supreme Court () and all ten seats on the state appellate courts.  Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. This change also began, likely in part, due to the same perception by voters of Democratic party efforts to disenfranchise voters again in 1994.  In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama, Sonny Hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican Oliver Hooper, Sr.  Hornsby sued Alabama in court and defiantly remained in office for more than a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.  This ultimately would lead to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles and ultimately losing the last of the nineteen court seats following the resignation of the last Democrat in August, 2011.

Today, Republicans also hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices.  Republicans also hold six of the eight elected seats on the State Board of Education.  In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years.  However, Democrats hold one of the three seats on the Alabama Public Service Commission.()()()

Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since Reconstruction, Windom and Ivey, the current Lieutenant Governor. Windom served as Lt. Governor under Democratic Gov. Siegelman.  Before 2011, the last time that Alabama had a governor and Lieutenant Governor of the same party was the period between 1983 and 1987 when Wallace was serving his fourth term as governor and Baxley was serving as Lieutenant Governor; both were Democrats.

In Alabama, the members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections, but the statewide officials, such as the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, and other constitutional offices take office in the following January.()

Local elections
Many local offices (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Local elections in most rural counties are generally decided in the Democratic primary and local elections in metropolitan and suburban counties are generally decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.()()

Alabama's 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan races and Democrats still retain the majority of those posts.  The current split is 42 Democrats, 24 Republicans, and 1 Independent (Choctaw).(Alabama Sheriff's Association)  However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties and the majority of Republican sheriffs preside over more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties.() Two Alabama counties (Montgomery and Calhoun) with a population of over 100,000 have Democratic sheriffs and five Alabama counties with a population of under 75,000 have Republican sheriffs (Autauga, Coffee, Dale, Coosa, and Blount).()  The state has one female sheriff (Morgan) and 9 African-American sheriffs.(Alabama Sheriffs Association)

Federal elections


From 1876 through 1956, Alabama supported only Democratic presidential candidates, by large margins. In 1960, the Democrats won with F. Kennedy on the ballot, but the Democratic electors from Alabama gave 6 of their 11 electoral votes as a protest to Harry Byrd. In 1964, Republican Goldwater carried the state.

In the 1968 presidential election, Alabama supported native son and Independent Party candidate Wallace over both Nixon and Humphrey. Wallace was the official Democratic candidate in Alabama, while Humphrey was listed as the "National Democratic".() In 1976, Democratic candidate Carter from Georgia carried the state, the region, and the nation, but Democratic control of the region slipped after that.

Since 1980, conservative Alabama voters have increasingly voted for Republican candidates at the Federal level, especially in Presidential elections. By contrast, Democratic candidates have been elected to many state-level offices and until 2010 comprised a longstanding majority in the Legislature; see Dixiecrat.

In 2004, W. Bush won Alabama's nine electoral votes by a margin of 25 percentage points with 62.5% of the vote, mostly white voters. The 11 counties that voted Democratic were Black Belt counties, where African Americans are the majority racial group.

The state's two U.S. senators are Jefferson B. Sessions III and Richard C. Shelby, both Republicans.

In the House of Representatives, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: (Bonner, D. Rogers, Aderholt, J. Brooks, Roby, and Bachus) and one Democrat: Sewell).


Education


Primary and secondary education
Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the overview of the State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,541 individual schools provide education for 743,364 elementary and secondary students.()

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006&#8211;2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year.( In 2007, over 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National Child Left Behind law, using measures determined by the State of Alabama. In 2004, 23 percent of schools met AYP.()

While Alabama's public education system has improved, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data, Alabama's high school graduation rate &#8211; 75% &#8211; is the second lowest in the United States (after Mississippi).(http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf)  The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.(Education Statistics. CensusScope.org)

Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to 16 doctoral level programs.( )()

The largest single campus is the of Alabama, located in Tuscaloosa, with 31,747 enrolled for fall 2011.(http://www.wtvy.com/home/headlines/University_of_Alabama_Reaches_Record_Enrollment_this_Fall_129916513.html) University is the largest institution in the state, enrolling 29,689 students (as of 2010) across four Alabama campuses (Troy, Dothan, Montgomery, and Phenix City), as well as sixty learning sites in seventeen other states and eleven other countries.  The oldest institutions are the public of North Alabama in Florence and the Catholic Church-affiliated Hill College in Mobile, both founded in 1830.()()

Accreditation of academic programs is through the Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) as well as other subject-focused national and international accreditation agencies such as the for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE),() the on Occupational Education (COE),()  and the Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS).()

According to the 2011 News and World Report, Alabama had three universities ranked in the top 100 Public Schools in America (University of Alabama at 31, University at 36, and of Alabama at Birmingham at 73).()

Protagonists


Dagny Taggart
Image:Taylor-Schilling-as-Dagny-Taggart.jpg|thumb|upright0.56|right|Schilling as Dagny Taggart in the 2011 film.
Dagny Taggart is the protagonist of the novel. She is Vice-President in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, under her brother, James Taggart. However, due to James' incompetence, it is Dagny who is responsible for all the workings of the railroad.

Dagny has three romantic relationships, each with a man of ability: d'Anconia, Rearden, and Galt. Galt marks the pinnacle of everything Dagny seeks in the world and is the kind of man alluded to in her youth when she imagines a man standing off in the distance, at the end of a great set of railroad tracks and all her struggles.

The essential drama of Dagny's character is her struggle to reconcile the life she lives and the railroad which she loves with the moral code of those who wish to destroy it. She believes these destroyers simply want to heap burdens upon her for the sake of others, which she has the ability to carry. Like Hank, she believes they want to live, but are too stupid and incompetent to realize how their duties and altruistic projects impede that goal. It is not until she sees the man most important to her in the world - John Galt - strapped to a torture machine, about to be killed by the looters (who recognize, too, that he is the only man who can save them from economic collapse), that she realizes that the moral code of the looters is one of death: they recognize what is good and necessary for life, but wish to destroy it anyway.

She is a typical heroine, similar to Francon (The Fountainhead) or Argounova (We the Living).

Francisco d'Anconia
Francisco d'Anconia is one of the central characters in Atlas Shrugged, and owner by inheritance of the world's largest copper mining empire. He is a childhood friend, and the first love, of Dagny Taggart.

A child prodigy of exceptional talents, Francisco was dubbed the "climax" of the d'Anconia line, an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists. He attended Patrick Henry University and was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskj&#246;ld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. He began working at a young age, while still in school, proving that he could have made a successful career on his own merits without the aid of his family's wealth and power. 

Francisco is one of the strikers and is slowly destroying the d'Anconia empire to put it out of the raiders' reach. His actions were designed both to "trap" looters into relying upon his worthless ventures in order to disrupt their schemes and to try to show the inevitable consequences of looting. He adopted the persona of a worthless playboy, by which he is known to the world, as an effective cover. However, he is forced to give up Dagny, knowing that she would not be ready to join the strikers. He remains deeply in love with her throughout the book, while also being a good and loyal friend of her other two lovers, Hank Rearden and John Galt.

His full name is Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d'Anconia.

John Galt

The enigmatic John Galt is the primary male hero of Atlas Shrugged. He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental, who often dines with Eddie Willers in the employee's cafeteria, and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental. Only Eddie's side of their conversations is given in the novel. Eddie tells him which suppliers and contractors Dagny is most dependent on; these men are consistently the next to disappear. Later in the novel, the reader discovers this worker's true identity.

Henry "Hank" Rearden
Henry (also known as "Hank") is one of the central characters in Shrugged. Like many of Rand's capitalist characters, he is a self-made man. He owns the most important steel company in the United States. He invents Rearden Metal, an alloy stronger than steel (with similar properties to stainless steel). He lives in Philadelphia with his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and his elderly mother, all of whom he supports.

Hank Rearden knows something is wrong with the world but he is unable to define the problem. His friend, Francisco d'Anconia, helps him understand and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in Galt's Speech. Rearden also serves to illustrate Rand's theory of sex. Lillian Rearden cannot appreciate Hank Rearden's virtues, and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex. Dagny Taggart clearly does appreciate Rearden's virtues, and this appreciation evolves into sexual desire. Rearden is torn because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct, but he responds sexually to Dagny, who represents his highest values. Rearden struggles to resolve this internal conflict, and in doing so, illustrates Rand's sexual theory.

Ragnar Danneskj&#246;ld
One of the original strikers, he is now world famous as a pirate. Ragnar attended Patrick Henry University and became friends with John Galt and Francisco d'Anconia while studying under Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. Danneskj&#246;ld seizes relief ships that are being sent from the States to The People's States of Europe. As the novel progresses, Danneskj&#246;ld begins to become active in American waters. Danneskj&#246;ld's action is to restore to other creative people the money, in gold, which was unjustly taken away from them&#8212;specifically, their tax payments.  He explains this is not altruism; his motivation is to ensure that once those espousing Galt's philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they will have enough capital to rebuild the world.

Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskj&#246;ld makes a personal appearance when he risks his life to meet Hank Rearden in the night and hand him a bar of gold as an "advance payment" to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation. Danneskj&#246;ld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a star who retired and dropped out of sight. It is mentioned that some of the strikers have strong reservations about his way of "conducting the common struggle."

According to Branden, who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing Danneskj&#246;ld's adventures at sea, which were cut from the final published text.(Reedstrom, Karen. 1992 Interview with Full Context. Barbara Branden interview in Full Context, October 1992. Republished on barbarabranden.com. Retrieved 1 June 2007.) In the published book, Danneskj&#246;ld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.


Antagonists


James Taggart
The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book's most important antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler who is, however, incapable of making operational decisions on his own. He relies on his sister, Dagny Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny.

As the novel progresses, the moral philosophy of the looters is revealed: it is a code of stagnation. The goal of this code is to not exist, to not move forward, to become a zero. Taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal. He maintains his pretense that he wants to live, and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.

Lillian Rearden
The unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden. They have been married eight years as the novel begins. Lillian is a frigid moocher who seeks to destroy her husband. She compares being Rearden's wife with owning the world's most powerful horse. Since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast, she must bridle it down to her level, even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be grievously wasted. Lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is 'realistic' enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts. She indicates that she abhors Francisco d'Anconia, because she believes he is a sexual adventurer.

As her motives become more clear, Lillian is found to share the sentiments of many other moochers and their worship of destruction. Her actions are explained as the desire to destroy achievement in the false belief that such an act bestows a greatness to the destroyer equal to the accomplishment destroyed. She seeks, then, to ruin Rearden in an effort to prove her own value.

Lillian achieves her goal to destroy Rearden's business, when she passes on information to James Taggart about her husband's affair. This information is used to persuade Rearden to sign the Gift Certificate (which delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to the looters) and thereby destroys his business. Lillian discovers that she can accomplish her goal to destroy the business but she can neither achieve the greatness she desires nor her goal to destroy Hank's character. She uses James Taggart for sex as victory and revenge against Hank and Dagny. This does give her the satisfaction she desires and she continues to manipulate Hank until he is finally leaves her and joins Galt's strikers.

Dr. Floyd Ferris

Ferris is a biologist who works as "co-ordinator" at the State Science Institute. He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled Why Do You Think You Think? He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal. He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan. Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon, and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader, a torture machine. When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt. Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.

Dr. Robert Stadler
A former professor at Patrick Henry University, mentor to Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt and Ragnar Danneskj&#246;ld. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: Project X (Xylophone). The character was, in part, modeled on Robert Oppenheimer, whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of weapons.(David Harriman, of Ayn Rand, pp. 311-344, esp. 330-331.) To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the "man who knew better" but chose not to act for the good.

Wesley Mouch
The incompetent and treacherous lobbyist  whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in Washington. Later in the novel, he becomes the country's economic dictator.

Secondary characters
The following secondary characters also appear in the novel.(Secondary characters are listed if they appear in character lists from any of the works used to establish the list of major characters above, but do not meet the criteria for "major." Minor characters who are not listed in secondary works are not listed here.)

*Hugh Akston is identified as "One of the last great advocates of reason." He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University, where he taught Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt, and Ragnar Danneskj&#246;ld. He was, along with Robert Stadler, a father figure to these three. Akston's name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. He now works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful at that. When Dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental.

*Jeff Allen is a tramp who stows away on a Taggart train during one of Dagny's cross-country trips. Instead of throwing him out, she allows him to ride as her guest. It is from Allen that she learns the full story behind the collapse of the Twentieth Century Motor Company (Rand's extensive metaphor for the inherent flaws of communism), as well as a hint of John Galt's true background.

*Calvin Atwood is owner of Atwood Light and Power Company and joins Galt's strike.

*Cherryl Brooks is a dime store shopgirl who marries James Taggart after a chance encounter in her store the night the John Galt Line was falsely deemed his greatest success.  She marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. Cherryl is at first harsh towards Dagny, having believed Jim Taggart's descriptions of his sister, until she questions employees of the railroad. Upon learning that her scorn had been misdirected, Cherryl puts off apologizing to Dagny out of shame until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to Dagny that when she married Jim, she thought he had the heroic qualities that she had looked up to - she thought she was marrying someone like Dagny. Upon realizing the nature of the moral code surrounding her, the apparent lack of escape for herself and the heroes she worships, and her unnamed desire to remove support from the machinations she abhors, Cherryl throws herself from a bridge to her death after witnessing her husband James Taggart sleeping with Lillian Rearden and after being beaten for showing James his code of death.

*Mayor Bascom is the mayor of Rome, Wisconsin, who reveals part of the history of the Twentieth Century Motor Company.

*Bill Brent is the chief dispatcher for the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental, who tries to prevent the Taggart Tunnel disaster.

*Dr. Blodgett is the scientist who pulls the lever to demonstrate Project X.

*Orren Boyle is the head of Associated Steel antithesis of Hank Rearden and a friend of James Taggart. He is an investor in the San Sebasti&#225;n Mines.

*Laura Bradford is an actress and Kip Chalmers's mistress.

*Kip Chalmers is a Washington man who has decided to run for election as Legislator from California. On the way to his campaign, the Taggart Transcontinental train that is carrying him encounters a split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine. His demands lead to a coal-burning steam engine being attached to his train in its stead and used to pull it through an eight-mile tunnel. The result is the suffocation of all passengers and the destruction of the Taggart Tunnel.

*Emma Chalmers, Kip Chalmers's mother, gains some influence after his death. Known as "Kip's Ma," she starts a soybean-growing project in Louisiana and commandeers thousands of railcars to move the harvest. As a result, the year's wheat crop from Minnesota never reaches the rest of the country, but instead rots in storage; also, the soybean crop is lost, having been reaped too early.

*Dan Conway is the middle-aged president of the Phoenix-Durango railroad. Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows. When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is used to drive his business out of Colorado, he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing.

*Ken Danagger owns Danagger Coal in Pennsylvania. He helps Hank Rearden illegally make Rearden Metal, then later decides to quit and join Galt's strike moments before Dagny arrives to try to persuade him otherwise.

*Quentin Daniels is an enterprising engineer hired by Dagny Taggart to reconstruct John Galt's motor. Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had. Dagny's pursuit of Quentin leads her to "Galt's Gulch".

*Sebastian d'Anconia was the 16th (or 17th) Century founder of the d'Anconia dynasty. Escaped from Spain because of expressing his opinions too freely and coming in conflict with the Inquisition, leaving behind a palace and his beloved. Started a small mine in South America, which became the beginning of a mining empire and a new fortune (and a new palace). Eventually sent for his beloved who had waited for him many years. He is the role model which Francisco d'Anconia looks to, as Dagny Taggart looks to Nathaniel Taggart. Francisco remarks that their respective ancestors would have liked each other.

*Balph Eubank is called "the literary leader of the age", despite the fact that he has never sold more than three thousand copies of his books. He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to ten thousand copies.

*The Fishwife is one of the strikers, who earns her living by providing the fish for Hammond&#8217;s grocery market; she is described as having "dark, disheveled hair and large eyes", and is a writer. Galt says she "wouldn't be published outside. She believes that when one deals with words, one deals with the mind." According to Branden in her book Passion of Ayn Rand, "The Fishwife is Ayn's Hitchcock-like appearance in Atlas Shrugged."()

*Lawrence Hammond runs Hammond Cars in Colorado, one of the few companies in existence that still produces top-quality vehicles. He eventually quits and joins the strike.

*Richard Halley is Dagny Taggart's favorite composer, who mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph. Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. At age 24, his opera Phaethon was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. After 19 years, Phaethon was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared.

*Mrs. William Hastings is the widow of the chief engineer at the Twentieth Century Motor Company. Her husband quit shortly after Galt did and joined the strike some years later. Her lead allows Dagny to find Hugh Akston.

*Dr. Thomas Hendricks is a famous brain surgeon who developed a new method of preventing strokes. He joined Galt's strike when the American medical system was put under government control.

*Tinky Holloway is one of the "looters" and is frequently referred to and quoted by other characters in the story, but he has only has one major appearance: during the Washington meeting with Hank Rearden.

*Lee Hunsacker is in charge of a company called Amalgamated Service when takes over the Twentieth Century Motor Company. He files a lawsuit that eventually leads to Midas Mulligan and Judge Narragansett joining the strike.

*Gwen Ives is Hank Rearden's secretary.

*Owen Kellogg is Assistant to the Manager of the Taggart Terminal in York. He catches Dagny Taggart's eye as one of the few competent men on staff. After seeing the sorry state of the Ohio Division, she decides to make him its new Superintendent. However, as soon as she returns to New York, Kellogg informs her that he is quitting his job. Owen Kellogg eventually reaches, and settles in, Galt's Gulch.

*Fred Kinnan is a labor leader and member of the looter cabal. Unlike the others, however, Kinnan is straightforward and honest about his purpose. Kinnan is the only one to openly state the true motivations of himself and his fellow conspirators. At the end of Galt's 3 hour speech, he expresses admiration for the man, as he says what he means. Despite this, Kinnan admits that he is one of the people Galt is out to destroy.

*Paul Larkin is an unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family. He meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down. James Taggart knows he is friends with Hank Rearden and challenges his loyalty, and Larkin assures Taggart that he will go along with them.

*Eugene Lawson heads the Community Bank of Madison, then gets a job with the government when it goes bankrupt.

*Mort Liddy is a hack composer who writes trite scores for movies and modern symphonies to which no one listens. He believes melody is a primitive vulgarity. He is one of Lillian Rearden's friends and a member of the cultural elite.

*Clifton Locey is a friend of Jim Taggart who takes the position of vice-president of operation when Dagny Taggart quits.

*Pat Logan is the engineer on the first run of the John Galt Line. He later strikes.

*Kay Ludlow is a beautiful actress and the wife of Ragnar Danneskj&#246;ld.

*Dick McNamara is a contractor who finished the San Sebastian Line. Dagny Taggart plans to hire him to lay the new Rearden Metal track for the Rio Norte Line, but before she does so, he mysteriously disappears. She later discovers that he has joined the strike and settled in Galt's Gulch.

*Cuffy Meigs is the Director of Unification for the railroad business. He carries a pistol and a lucky rabbit's foot, and he dresses in a military uniform, and has been described as "impervious to thought". Meigs seizes control of Project X and accidentally destroys it, demolishing the country's last railroad bridge across the Mississippi River and killing himself, his men, and Dr. Stadler.

*Dave Mitchum is a state-hired superintendent of the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental. He is partially responsible for the Taggart Tunnel disaster.

*Chick Morrison holds the position of "Morale Conditioner" in the government.

*Horace Bussby Mowen is the president of the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc. of Connecticut. He is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society. Dagny Taggart hires Mowen to produce switches made of Rearden Metal. He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be cajoled into accepting the contract. When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative source.

*Midas Mulligan is a wealthy banker who mysteriously disappeared in protest after he was given a court order to lend money to an incompetent applicant. When the order came down he liquidated his entire business, paid off his depositors, and joined Galt's strike. Mulligan's birth name was Michael, but he had it legally changed after a news article called him "Midas" in a derogatory fashion, which Mulligan took as a compliment.

*Judge Narragansett is an American jurist who ruled in favor of Midas Mulligan during the case brought against him by the incompetent loan applicant. When Narragansett's ruling was reversed on appeal, he retired and joined the strike. At the end of the novel, he is seen editing the States Constitution, crossing out the contradicting amendments of it and adding an amendment to prohibit Congress from passing laws that restrain freedom of trade.

*Ben Nealy is a railroad contractor whom Dagny Taggart hires to replace the track on the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal. Nealy is incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country. Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power. He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement. He relies on Dagny and Ellis Wyatt to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around.

*Betty Pope is a wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with James Taggart. She is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position.

*Dr. Potter holds some undefined position with the State Science Institute. He is sent to try to obtain the rights to Rearden Metal.

*Dr. Simon Pritchett is the prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University and is considered the leading philosopher of the age. He believes that man is nothing but a collection of chemicals, reason is a superstition, it is futile to seek meaning in life, and the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood.

*Rearden's mother, whose name is not mentioned, lives with Rearden at his home in Philadelphia. She is involved in charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can. She dotes on her weak son Philip Rearden.

*Philip Rearden is the younger brother of Hank Rearden. He lives in his brother's home in Philadelphia and is completely dependent on him. He is resentful of his brother's charity.

*Dwight Sanders owns Sanders Aircraft, a producer of high-quality airplanes, and joins the strike.

*Bertram Scudder is an editorial writer for the magazine The Future. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on Hank Rearden called The Octopus. He is also vocal in support of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.

*Claude Slagenhop is president of political organization Friends of Global Progress and one of Lillian Rearden's friends. He believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action. Global Progress is a sponsor of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.

*Gerald and Ivy Starnes are the two surviving children of Jed Starnes; together with their since-deceased brother Eric, they instituted a communistic payment-and-benefits program at Twentieth Century Motors which drove the company into bankruptcy. Gerald, a dying alcoholic, and Ivy, a pseudo-Buddhist ascetic, continue to insist that the plan was perfect and that the failure of their father's company was entirely due to the workers.

*Andrew Stockton runs the Stockton Foundry in Stockton, Colorado. When he joins the strike, he opens a foundry in Galt's Gulch.

*Nathaniel Taggart was the founder of Taggart Transcontinental. He built his railroad without any government handouts, and ran the business for no other reason than to turn a profit. He began as a penniless adventurer and ended up as one of the wealthiest men in the country. He never earned money by force or fraud, and never apologized for becoming wealthy and successful. He was one of the most hated men of his time. Dagny is often inspired by looking at a statue of Nat Taggart at the railroad headquarters.

*Mr. Thompson is the "Head of the State" for the States. He is not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rand's notes indicate that she modeled him on President S. Truman, and that she deliberately decided not to call him "of the United States" as this title has "honorable connotations" which the character does not deserve.

*Lester Tuck is the press agent for Kip Chalmers.

*Clem Weatherby is a government representative on the board of directors of Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny considers him the least bad of the government representatives, since he does have some real knowledge on the running of trains. She notices, however, that he is the least appreciated by his own bosses.

*The Wet Nurse (Tony) is a young bureaucrat sent by the government to watch over Rearden&#8217;s mills. Though he starts out as a cynical follower of the looters&#8217; code, his experience at the mills transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers. He is shot attempting to inform Hank Rearden about a government plot, but does succeed in warning Rearden just before he dies.

*Edwin "Eddie" Willers is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. He grew up with Dagny Taggart. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and he followed in their footsteps. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. He is also secretly in love with Dagny. Willers is generally assumed to represent the common man: someone who does not possess the Promethean creative ability of The Strikers, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. He sticks it out with the railway to the bitter end, even when the old world is obviously collapsing and Dagny has shifted her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt. In the end, he stays with the broken-down Comet in the middle of the desert, like a captain going down with his ship. It is unclear whether or not the strikers or anyone else will return to save him.

*Ellis Wyatt is the head of Wyatt Oil. He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of Colorado by discovering a new process for extracting more oil from what were thought to be exhausted oil wells. When first introduced, he is aggressive towards Dagny, whom he does not yet know and whom he blames for what are, in fact, her brother's policies which directly threaten his business. When the government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him to continue, he sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a jeering note: "I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours." One particular burning well that resists all efforts to extinguish it becomes known as "Wyatt's Torch". Later Dagny meets him in Galt's Gulch.

Main protagonists
Crash Bandicoot


Aku Aku

Aku Aku is the guardian of the Wumpa Islands and the father figure of Crash and his friends. He is voiced by Winkler in his English speaking appearances up to Crash Twinsanity, and by Eagles in Crash of the Titans and Crash: Mind over Mutant. He is voiced by Kenichi Ogata in the Japanese versions of his speaking appearances up to Crash Twinsanity.

Aku Aku is the spirit of an ancient doctor encased in a floating, wooden mask.() When he sensed Crash's mission to stop Doctor Cortex, he scattered copies of himself throughout the Wumpa Islands in an effort to aid him in his mission.( Whenever Crash possesses an Aku Aku mask, he will be shielded from one enemy attack or contact. Collecting three Aku Aku masks gives Crash temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers.() In Bandicoot 3: Warped, Aku Aku's evil younger brother Uka Uka is introduced when the ruins of Cortex's space station crash into Earth and set Uka Uka free. Aku Aku tells Crash and Coco the story of how he locked Uka Uka up in an underground prison many eons ago.() He then gives the two the assignment of gathering Crystals that lay scattered throughout time and keep them from the hands of Uka Uka and Doctor Cortex.() During Crash's final fight against Doctor Neo Cortex, Aku Aku fends off Uka Uka's attacks while the fight is in session. Aku Aku appears in Crash Team Racing as a tutor for the characters Crash, Coco, Polar and Pura, giving them useful tips and tricks throughout the game. He also appears as a power-up during the races, protecting the said characters from all attacks and obstacles while giving them a speed boost.() However, he cannot protect the characters from chasms and deep water.( In Crash Bash, in order to resolve his constant fighting with Uka Uka, Aku Aku summons Crash and Coco as part of a contest between his players against Uka Uka, Aku Aku is later allowed to have Tiny and Dingodile into his team as to even out the number of players between them. During the course of the tournament, Aku Aku begins to suspect that Uka Uka is using the tournament to disguise a secret plot of his own. He discovers this plot to steal Crystals just in time for his team to win. Aku Aku locks the Crystals up into a secret cabinet for safekeeping, and banishes Uka Uka into the vacuum of space as punishment for trying to abuse the power of the Crystals.

When disasters ravage the world in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, Aku Aku discovers that Uka Uka and Doctor Cortex have unleashed a group of destructive masks known as the Elementals, and calls upon Crash and Coco Bandicoot to gather Crystals and return the Elementals to their hibernation state. In Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced, Aku Aku saves Crash from being kidnapped by Nefarious Tropy and N. Trance, and sends him off to gather Crystals so that he may be able to reach the villains. Aku Aku reprises his role from Crash Team Racing in Crash Nitro Kart, giving useful advice and acting as a power-up for the characters Crash, Coco and Crunch. In Crash Twinsanity, Aku Aku convinces Uka Uka to join him in order to defeat the Evil Twins, but both are easily defeated when they attempt this.

Aku Aku has a cameo appearance in Crash Tag Team Racing as the tiki masks in the "Tiki Turbo" track. He also appears as the tutor in Crash Boom Bang!, giving the player instructions on how to play the game. In Crash of the Titans, Aku Aku is captured by Doctor Neo Cortex, but is rescued by Crash Bandicoot. Throughout the game, Aku Aku gives the player basic instructions, shields Crash from enemy attacks, and transforms into a skateboard to help Crash traverse slippery terrain. He reprises this role for Crash: Mind over Mutant. Aku Aku is one of the only two characters in the game unable to be controlled by Cortex's NV device, as the device is too small to fit on his head.


Reception
A reviewer for Revolution compared the mechanics of the Aku Aku masks to the shields of the Sonic the Hedgehog series.() John Scalzo of Target commented that the "booooo-ahhhhhh!" chant made by Aku Aku is "pretty slick".() The sound quality of Aku Aku's voice in Crash Team Racing was praised by SolidSnake of PSX Extreme,() while Arnold Katayev, in his review of Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, negatively described Aku Aku's voice as "melodramatic".() Steven Rodriguez, in his World Report review of Crash Nitro Kart, described Aku Aku's voice when giving advice between races as "sexy" and cited it as the best part of the game's audio, but admitted that "even he gets rather annoying."() In his review of Crash of the Titans, Brian Rowe of Game Revolution, while citing the ability to "slap Aku Aku&#8217;s face into the ground and ride it like a surfboard" as "harshly inconsiderate", considered it "payback for his gratingly poor impersonations of that other floating head of wisdom &#8211; Frylock."()

Coco Bandicoot


Crunch Bandicoot
Crunch Bandicoot is a genetically altered bandicoot who was originally created by Doctor Cortex to destroy Crash Bandicoot. After his defeat to Crash, Crunch had a change of heart and now tries to be a positive role model to children. He is Crash and Coco's little brother and protects them from harm. He is voiced by Michael Richardson in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex and Crash Nitro Kart, and by Chris Williams (in the style of T) in the Radical Entertainment games. In the Japanese version of the series, he is voiced by Kishi in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex and Crash Nitro Kart, by Kimura in Crash Tag Team Racing, and by Fukumatsu in Crash Boom Bang!.

Crunch was created by Doctor Cortex in private as a superweapon that would be capable of frightening power. Doctor N. Gin and Doctor Nefarious Tropy (who only had a slight understanding of the project) were the only other individuals who knew about the weapon. During a bad guy convention held by Uka Uka, Tropy and N. Gin reveal the weapon in desperation for one good plan to defeat Crash Bandicoot, whom Uka Uka wants eliminated.() Doctor Cortex formally announces the superweapon, but reveals that it is still missing a power source.() Hearing the word "element", Uka Uka brings up the Elementals, a group of destructive masks that could create enough energy to bring the secret weapon to life. The weapon, who is Crunch Bandicoot, attempts to defeat Crash with the aid of the Elemental masks, but when Crunch is defeated in Cortex's space station, he snaps out of Doctor Cortex's control. Although his first instinct is to introduce his fist to Cortex's face, Aku Aku informs Crunch of the space station's imminent destruction, and the group decides to flee back to Earth.() Back on Earth, Crunch shows his gratitude toward the Bandicoots, and becomes part of the Bandicoot family.() In Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced, Crunch is abducted by N. Trance and is brainwashed alongside Coco and Fake Crash. Crash battles Crunch on a flying carpet over the skies of Saudi Arabia, with Crash firing shots of energy at Crunch whenever the latter is stunned by exploding Nitro crates. Upon snapping out of N. Trance's control, Crunch becomes a playable character in some of the Atlasphere levels. Crunch is a playable character in Crash Nitro Kart as well. In Crash Twinsanity, Crunch has a cameo in Crash's "birthday party", which is a gathering of past Crash villains. While Crunch is in the gathering, he actually believes that it is really Crash's birthday, donning a green paper crown and holding a slice of cake. Crunch has a minor appearance in Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage, aiding Crash in the "Weighlift" segments of the game.

Crunch appears as a playable character in Nitro Kart Crash Tag Team Racing and Crash Boom Bang!. In Crash of the Titans, Crunch is ambushed by Doctor Cortex during the beginning of the first episode, leaving him frozen from the neck down. He stays this way until the end of the game, in which the Doominator's collapse is able to set Crunch free. Crunch does not appear in the DS version of the game. In the Game Boy Advance version, Crunch is taken prisoner by Tiny Tiger by order of Neo Cortex. He is freed upon Tiny's defeat. Crunch appears in Crash: Mind over Mutant and becomes addicted to the NV device alongside Coco to the point where he is unable to help Crash and Aku Aku when they are attacked by N. Gin's Ratnician army.() He is later mutated by the bad Mojo transmitted by the NV and runs off, leaving a mutated Coco to fend off Crash. He is later found at the Junkyard, where Nitrus Brio commands Crunch to attack Crash. He is soon freed from the NV's control, but continues to be beaten up by an unaware Crash for a short time. He then decides to go back home and get some sleep.


Main antagonists
Doctor Neo Cortex


Doctor N. Gin
Doctor N. Gin, spelled "N-Gin" in the Radical Entertainment games, was the right-hand man of Doctor Neo Cortex, replacing Doctor Nitrus Brio after Crash Bandicoot.() He has since been replaced by the person he succeeded, Nitrus Brio. He is voiced by Brendan O'Brien in the Naughty Dog games, by Burton in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, by Flynn in Crash Nitro Kart and Crash Twinsanity, and by North (in the style of Lorre) in the Radical Entertainment games. In the Japanese version of the series, he is voiced by Nakata in the games up to Crash Twinsanity, and by Ogata in "Crash Tag Team Racing". His name is a wordplay on the word "engine".

As a child, N. Gin was a classmate of Neo Cortex and Nitrus Brio in Madame Amberley's Academy of Evil.() After working at a stapler factory for a time,() N. Gin went on to become a world-renowned physicist in the industry. However, due to a budget cut,( one of his missile projects ended up faulty and, as a result, went awry, lodging itself into N. Gin's head.( With his intellect, N. Gin was able to stabilize the weapon and reconstruct it as a life support system at the cost of his sanity.() Because the missile is still live, it activates whenever N. Gin is stressed or angry, leaving him with a large headache (a trait inspired by creator Rubin's own chronic migraine headaches).( Shortly after the missile incident, Doctor N. Gin was taken in by Doctor Neo Cortex to replace the double-crossed Doctor Nitrus Brio.( Studying a large Crystal found by Cortex after his defeat to Crash Bandicoot, N. Gin discovers that 25 smaller "Slave Crystals" are needed alongside this "Master Crystal" in order to power Cortex's new "Cortex Vortex" device.() When Crash is ordered by Doctor Cortex to give the Crystals he has gathered to N. Gin, N. Gin attempts to take the Crystals by force, only to be sent spiraling into the vacuum of space when Crash destroys his prized mecha. After the destruction of this mecha, N. Gin constructed a superior model: a suit of mobile armor that could transform into a space fighter and dock with a huge weapon platform.() N. Gin uses this machine to confront Coco Bandicoot on the Moon in "Bandicoot 3: Warped", only to fail once again. N. Gin appears as a playable character in "Crash Team Racing" and as an obstacle in a "Ballistix" level in "Crash Bash". The epilogue of "Crash Team Racing" states that N. Gin opened a custom auto parts store in Ohio, only to have it close down after a massive recall due to the damage caused by his patented "Clear-the-Road" missile system.()

In Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, N. Gin is an attendee of Uka Uka's bad guy convention, and is ultimately the one who reveals the secret of Crunch Bandicoot, Cortex's new superweapon.( For the rest of the game, N. Gin serves as an obstacle in some of the levels. In Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure, N. Gin battles Crash in the skies with a weapon platform similar to the one he piloted in Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. He is later merged with Doctor Cortex, Tiny and Dingodile, and becomes Mega-Mix. After chasing Crash down a space station hall, Mega-Mix is left inside the space station, which explodes with the villains in it. N. Gin is a playable character in Crash Nitro Kart. In one cutscene, N. Gin considers creating cybernetic sharks as new henchmen after racing Nash.() In Crash Twinsanity, N. Gin appears during the first boss battle, piloting the Mecha-Bandicoot in an attempt to eliminate Crash. When all of its weapons are destroyed, the Mecha-Bandicoot stomps a hole into the floor and falls into a cavern. N. Gin is later seen as the captain of his own battleship. At the nest, N. Gin tries to destroy Crash with a barrage of missiles, occasionally tossing a TNT Crate. This leads to the eventual collapse of the crow's nest, causing N. Gin to land on his head onto a pile of TNT Crates, creating a large explosion that sinks the battleship. N. Gin is last seen teamed up with N. Tropy and N. Brio, with all of them trying to steal the Evil Twins' riches. However, they are driven out by Spyro the Dragon.

N. Gin is a playable character in Crash Tag Team Racing. In the game's story, N. Gin convinces Neo Cortex to join in the search for Von Clutch's missing Power Gems so that he can use Von Clutch's theme park as a new base of operations (although Cortex later claims the idea as his own).() He has a cameo appearance in the "Silhouette Quiz" minigame in Crash Boom Bang!. In Crash of the Titans, N. Gin opposes Doctor Cortex's replacement by praising Cortex's stationery.() N. Gin is next seen in his weapons factory, which appears on the outside as a version of the of Liberty modelled after N. Gin. This factory constantly bombards the surrounding area with all kinds of explosives in an attempt to hinder Crash. Inside the factory, N. Gin communicates to his workers through the factory intercom, making announcements, singing inspirational songs, or alerting the workers of Crash's presence. In the factory's crown, N. Gin spends his days performing on his enormous pipe organ. When confronted by Crash and Aku Aku, N. Gin indirectly reveals to them that he has mixed feelings over Cortex's replacement to Nina. One side likes Doctor Cortex and the abuse he brings to him and wishes for his return, while another side approves of Nina's new way of doing things, believing that she is a more efficient leader than Cortex. Eventually, the two sides reach a compromise, and tell Crash of Uka Uka's whereabouts in hopes that he will also free Cortex, planning to shower them with doom later on.()() In Crash: Mind over Mutant, N. Gin leads an attack on Crash Bandicoot when Coco and Crunch become addicted to Cortex's and Brio's personal digital assistant, fleeing to a small observatory on Wumpa Island afterwards. When Crash and Aku Aku catch up to him, N. Gin reveals that ever since Doctor Cortex escaped the Doominator, he has been secretly watching the Bandicoot family and collecting information on them, hoping to be rewarded with the ownership of Wumpa Island if Cortex is triumphant in his current plot. After Crash fends off N. Gin's army of Ratnicians, N. Gin is sternly told by Aku Aku to leave the island, to which N. Gin reluctantly complies.()


Doctor Nitrus Brio
Doctor Nitrus Brio is a scientist who formerly worked under Doctor Neo Cortex. Brio was created by Naughty Dog as a foil for Doctor Cortex: "meek to Cortex's strength, logical to Cortex's emotional, successful (his inventions work) to Cortex's failure."( Brio is voiced by Brendan O'Brien in the English versions of Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bash, and by LaMarche in Crash: Mind over Mutant. He is voiced by Ogata in the Japanese version of the series up to Crash Bash.  His name is often abbreviated to "N. Brio", a wordplay on "embryo".

As a child, Nitrus Brio was a classmate of Neo Cortex and N. Gin in Madame Amberly's Academy of Evil.( Brio is responsible for creating the first fully functional Evolvo-Ray.() However, his lack of self-esteem allowed Doctor Cortex to take credit for the creation.( Brio is the penultimate boss of the first game, transforming himself into a hulking beast (through use of his trademark mutagenic agent), to combat Crash. After his failure, Brio left Cortex to become a bartender. Whilst away, he plotted to destroy Cortex for good with the use of a giant laser. Brio manages to convince Crash to gather the 42 Gems needed for the laser to be operational, and gives him the honor of activating the weapon, destroying Cortex's space station. While Brio does not appear in Crash Team Racing, a brand of beakers used as weapons during the races feature his name. Brio reunites with Cortex as a playable character in Crash Bash.

In Crash Twinsanity, Brio teams up with Doctor Nefarious Tropy to defeat Cortex and gain the Evil Twins Treasure. He appears alongside Tropy in a boss fight, immediately following Crash's escape from N. Gin's battleship, in which Brio (after being instructed by N. Tropy to "get changed") drinks a potion to transform himself into a large, green frog-like monster. He then appears (in his human form) alongside N. Tropy and N. Gin again in the Evil Twins' fortress, claiming the Twins' treasure for themselves. However, they are thwarted by Spyro the Dragon, who had been trapped in the Twins' vault.

Brio reunites with Neo Cortex once more in Crash: Mind over Mutant, in which he aids in the development of the NV, a personal digital assistant that can control both mutants and bandicoots. He uses recycled parts from the Sludge Junkyard to mass-produce NVs and create a new space station for Doctor Cortex. Throughout the game, he claims to be the inventor of numerous things, including recycling,() Slinkies() and endings (though he does acknowledge he did not invent LiteBrite).() He is found in the Junkyard with a brainwashed Crunch Bandicoot by Crash and Aku Aku, who are then attacked by Crunch under Brio's orders. When Crunch is broken free from the NV's control, Brio is forced to reveal the whereabouts of Uka Uka, who is acting as the source of the negative Mojo needed to control those wearing NVs. He is then told to leave the island, but promises that it is not the end.(


Uka Uka
Uka Uka is the evil younger twin brother of Aku Aku. Uka Uka was created by Naughty Dog as a presence that was able to cause even Neo Cortex to cower in fear.( He was voiced by Brown from 1998 to 2003, by Alex Fernandez in Crash Twinsanity, and by DiMaggio in Crash of the Titans and Crash: Mind over Mutant. He is voiced by &#332;tomo in the Japanese versions of his appearances up to Crash Twinsanity.

Several eons before the events of the series, Uka Uka was locked away by Aku Aku in an underground prison due to his malevolent nature.( Several millennia after his incarceration, Uka Uka recruits Doctor Cortex to fulfill his desire to enslave humanity, only to have Doctor Cortex lose the Crystals and the Gems, and have his space station destroyed.() The rubble of the ruined space station eventually crash-lands onto Earth, destroying the underground prison, and finally freeing Uka Uka. Upset with Cortex's failure to retrieve the Crystals and the Gems, Uka Uka recruits Doctor Nefarious Tropy, who has created the Time Twister, which will allow them to collect the Crystals and the Gems in their original places. And, since Cortex's failure also managed to set him free, Uka Uka still felt a sense of gratitude and generosity. When Crash intervenes and destroys the Time Twister, Uka Uka is trapped inside a time prison with Doctor Cortex and N. Tropy, who have been turned into infants. Uka Uka appears in Crash Team Racing as a tutor for the characters Cortex, N. Gin, Tiny, and Dingodile, giving them useful tips and tricks throughout the game. He also appears as a power-up during the races, protecting the said characters (along with Ripper Roo, Papu Papu, Komodo Joe, Pinstripe Potoroo and Doctor Nefarious Tropy) from all attacks and obstacles while giving them a speed boost.( However, he cannot protect the characters from chasms and deep water.( In Crash Bash, in order to resolve his constant fighting with Aku Aku, Uka Uka summons Cortex, Brio, Tiny, Dingodile, Koala Kong, and Rilla Roo as part of a contest between his players against Aku Aku. Uka Uka is later forced to relinquish Tiny and Dingodile to Aku Aku's team to even out the number of players between them.

In Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, Uka Uka scolds Cortex and the rest of the villains for their less-than-impressive evil productivity. Fed up with Cortex's incompetence, Uka Uka concludes that if global domination is to ever be achieved, Crash should be handled with personally.() Deciding to use Cortex's new super-weapon to wipe out Crash Bandicoot, he revives the Elementals to act as the super-weapon's source of power and bring it to life. When Crash imprisons the Elementals, defeats the super-weapon, and brings it to their side, Uka Uka holds Cortex responsible and fires an energy blast at him out of anger, but in doing so causes their newly built space station to overload, forcing Cortex and Uka Uka to evacuate. Their escape pod lands in the depths of Antarctica, stranding them both on a sheet of ice. Uka Uka oversees the evil plots of both Neo Cortex and Nefarious Tropy in Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure and Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced respectively, becoming annoyed when both of them fail. Uka Uka reprises his role from Crash Team Racing in Crash Nitro Kart, giving useful advice and acting as a power-up for the characters Neo Cortex, N. Gin, Tiny Tiger and N. Tropy. In Crash Twinsanity, Uka Uka is freed from a wall of ice, but is enraged to see that Cortex has teamed up with Crash in order to defeat the Evil Twins, and transforms into an Ice Titan in order to kill both of them. When he is defeated, Uka Uka attempts to flee, but Aku Aku stops him and tells him about the Evil Twins' plot to destroy the Earth. Opposed to the fact that someone else is trying to destroy the world (a job that he believes is his), Uka Uka temporarily teams up with his twin brother, only to be defeated alongside him by the Evil Twins' ability to warp reality.

Uka Uka has a cameo appearance in Crash Boom Bang! as a purchaseable power-up. In Crash of the Titans, Uka Uka teaches Doctor Cortex a new process called "Mojo mutations", which uses a magical substance known as Mojo to mutate any living creature into a loyal minion of Cortex. At the Temple of Zoom, Uka Uka leaves Doctor Cortex to destroy Crash and Aku Aku while he returns to the base with an enormous amount of stolen Mojo and Coco Bandicoot at tow.() When Cortex fails to defeat Crash, Uka Uka becomes furious, and announces that he is replacing Doctor Cortex, much to the shock of his minions. In a lab on the island's giant tree, Uka Uka expresses his relief with Nina Cortex's higher competence, but begins to sense Aku Aku's presence nearby, and decides to stay in the lab and kill Crash Bandicoot himself. Uka Uka confronts Crash as the penultimate boss by using Doctor Cortex's Evolvo-Ray on himself, giving him a gargantuan body made from the tree's wood. When the Evolvo-Ray is destroyed, Uka Uka claims that he will have the last laugh, as Nina is about to launch the Doominator, threatening the existence of Wumpa Island. Uka Uka is absent in the Nintendo DS version of the game. In Crash: Mind over Mutant, Uka Uka is subdued and placed in a milking machine by Doctor Neo Cortex and Doctor Nitrus Brio so that he can be used as a source of the bad Mojo needed to control those using the mass-produced NV device. He is eventually freed by Crash and Aku Aku, and promises to take the two to Cortex's new space station if his magical bones are returned to him. When this task is completed, Uka Uka keeps his promise and warps Crash and Aku Aku to Cortex's space station as an act of vengeance against Cortex.


Tiny Tiger
Tiny Tiger, erroneously named Taz Tiger in the pause screen of the North American version of Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, is a minion of Doctor Neo Cortex. He is voiced by Brendan O'Brien in the PlayStation games, by DiMaggio in Crash Nitro Kart by Chris Williams (in the style of Tyson) in Crash of the Titans and Crash: Mind over Mutant, and by Nolan North in the DS version of Crash of the Titans. In the Japanese version of the series, he is voiced by Tachiki in the PlayStation games, and by Masafumi Kimura in Crash Nitro Kart.

It is implied in at least two instruction manuals that Tiny was Doctor Cortex's first foray into genetic alteration.()() However, this conflicts with what was established by Naughty Dog, who confirmed that Ripper Roo was Cortex's first serious creation.() Following the orders of Doctor Nitrus Brio, Tiny attempts to eliminate Crash as the third boss of Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, but is unsuccessful in the end. By Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped, Tiny has joined forces with Doctor Neo Cortex and Uka Uka. His first duty working under Cortex is attempting to take whatever Crystals Crash and Coco have gathered and bringing them to Cortex in the Colosseum.() Tiny is once again unsuccessful, as a fight against Crash in the Colosseum proves fruitless. Tiny appears as a playable character in Crash Team Racing and Crash Bash. The epilogue of Crash Team Racing states that Tiny moved to Hills and founded a chain of fitness clubs after the events of the game.()

In Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, Tiny is an attendee in Uka Uka's bad guy convention, not speaking a single line in the entire game. He later serves as an obstacle in certain levels, literally standing in Crash's way in an attempt to hinder him, as well as operating various flying vehicles in levels involving planes or spaceships. In Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure, Tiny serves as the third boss, fighting Crash near a large waterfall. He is later merged with Doctor Cortex, N. Gin, and Dingodile, and becomes Mega-Mix. After chasing Crash down a space station hall, Mega-Mix is left inside the space station, which explodes with the villains in it. Tiny is a playable character in Crash Nitro Kart. In the game's story, Tiny is seen playing checkers with himself (and later, attempting to assist N. Gin) when the tower the villains are standing in is abducted. When Emperor Velo is defeated, Tiny, Cortex, and N. Gin are teleported to Terra, where Tiny gains the respect of the inhabitants. Tiny has a cameo appearance (along with other Crash villains) in Crash Twinsanity during Crash's "birthday party". In the crossover game Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage, Tiny acts as the second boss, attempting to obliterate Crash in a frozen tundra with a tank.

Tiny has a cameo appearance in Crash Boom Bang!, appearing in the "Silhouette Quiz" minigame. In Crash of the Titans, Tiny protests Neo Cortex's replacement alongside Doctor N. Gin by praising Cortex's stationery.( Tiny is the one in charge of the mining operations seen in Episodes 5 through 7, responsible for destroying a portion of the jungle and obtaining minerals from the volcano. When Crash distrupts these operations, Tiny confronts Crash directly and voices his displeasure in both Crash's antics and the fact that he wasn't invited to Crash Tag Team Racing.() When Crash confronts Tiny with the Shellephant, Tiny decides to reveal the whereabouts of Crash's sister.() Although Tiny isn't seen physically in Crash: Mind over Mutant, his voice can be heard in the game's credits when he tries to correct Crunch when he mixes up his metaphors.


Dingodile
Dingodile is a minion of Doctor Neo Cortex. Dingodile was created when Naughty Dog member Labbe asked for a character that was a cross between a dingo and a crocodile.( Dingodile is voiced by Hootkins in Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped, by Chip Chinery in Crash Team Racing, by Schultz in Crash Nitro Kart and Crash Twinsanity, and by Nolan North in the Nintendo DS version of Crash of the Titans. In the Japanese version of the series, he is voiced by Ishida in the PlayStation games, and by Iijima in Crash Nitro Kart and Crash Twinsanity.

Dingodile made his debut in the video game Crash Bandicoot: Warped as the second boss of the game. Here, he is seen serving under Uka Uka and Doctor Cortex, attempting to take whatever Crystals Crash has gathered and bringing them to Cortex during the Ice Age under his orders.() Crash encounters Dingodile as he is about to kill a penguin, who runs away upon Crash's arrival. When Dingodile is defeated, he warns Crash of the more powerful enemies he will face ahead as the penguin he tried to kill earlier hops up and down on his charred body.() Dingodile is a playable character in Crash Team Racing and Crash Bash. The epilogue of Crash Team Racing states that Dingodile created an animal breeding program to create unique and interesting pets.()

Dingodile appears as an attendee of Uka Uka's bad guy convention.  He later serves as an obstacle in certain levels, firing spurts of flamethrower ammo in an attempt to stop Crash. In Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure, Dingodile serves as the first boss. He fights Crash in a shark-infested underwater cavern, and fires torpedoes at the cavern ceiling in an attempt to impale Crash with the falling stalactites, but eventually manages to impale himself, leaving him open for attack. He is later merged with Doctor Cortex, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger, and becomes Mega-Mix. After chasing Crash down a space station hall, Mega-Mix is left inside the space station, which explodes with the villains in it. Dingodile is a playable character in Crash Nitro Kart. In the game's story, Dingodile is seen assisting Doctor N. Gin when the tower the villains are standing in is abducted. The next time he is seen, he is brainwashed by N. Trance and racing under N. Trance's team, which drives green vehicles. In Crash Twinsanity, Dingodile is seen as one of the attendees of Crash's "birthday party" (which is really a gathering of past villains in the Crash series). After watching the ensuing boss battle, he discusses lunch with Ripper Roo. Later, he is seen reading inside a small shack, but is interrupted when a large snowball (containing Crash and Cortex) crushes the shack with him in it. As Cortex laments his humiliation, Dingodile learns of the Evil Twins' treasure,() and secretly follows Crash and Cortex to the boiler room of Madame Amberly's Academy of Evil, where he tries to kill Crash for the treasure, believing he already has it. However, with the help of the boiler room's emergengy sprinkler system, Crash is able to disable Dingodile's flamethrower and beat him into submission. Dingodile is last seen laying unconscious in the boiler room.

While Dingodile doesn't appear in the console version of Crash of the Titans, he appears as the first boss in the DS and Boy Advance versions on the game. In the Nintendo DS version, Dingodile is assigned to stalling Crash Bandicoot while the other villains gather materials and build Neo Cortex's new CortexBot. Dingodile attempts to defeat Crash with a new water cannon, but ultimately fails. In the Game Boy Advance version, Dingodile is given the task of sending barrels of oil from Wumpa Island to Tiki Island. He is defeated by Crash, who attacks him with inhabited bee hives.


Doctor Nefarious Tropy
Doctor Nefarious Tropy is a henchman of Uka Uka and the self-proclaimed master of time. He was created by Naughty Dog as a time traveling boss that would fit in a time traveling plot.( Tropy is voiced by Ensign in all his speaking appearances excluding Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, in which he is voiced by Burton. He is voiced by Ikeda in the Japanese versions of Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped, Crash Team Racing and Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex and by Sat&#333; in the Japanese versions of Crash Nitro Kart and Crash Twinsanity.  His name is abbreviated as N. Tropy, which is a play on "entropy", a comment on his clock like form, and such is usually mentioned or unlocked from the time challenge awards inside games (Relic Races and Time Trials)

Doctor Nefarious Tropy is introduced by Uka Uka in Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped as the creator of the Time-Twisting Machine, a device that will aid Neo Cortex in his quest to gather the Crystals in their original places in time. He later acts as the third boss of the game, battling Crash with his gigantic tuning fork. When Cortex is defeated, the Time-Twisting Machine implodes on itself, trapping Cortex, Uka Uka and Tropy in a time prison, where they are transformed into infants. Tropy appears in Crash Team Racing as the player's opponent during the Time Trial races and later as an unlockable playable character. The game's epilogue states that Tropy resumed his time machine hobby after the events of the game, and was last seen entering an ancient rainforest.()

N. Tropy has a minor appearance in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, in which he is an attendee of Uka Uka's convention and an occasional enemy in the game, attempting to hinder Crash's progress. He is the main antagonist of Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced, in which he kidnaps Crunch, Coco and Fake Crash and hypnotizes them into working for him. He is later defeated by Crash and is forced to take a group picture with the Bandicoots. Tropy is an unlockable character in Crash Nitro Kart, where he races under Neo Cortex's team. Tropy appears again in Crash Twinsanity, where he works with Doctor Nitrus Brio in order to learn the whereabouts of the treasure of the Evil Twins. When interrogating Crash proves fruitless, the duo attack him, sending him back to Cortex's Iceberg Lab. They eventually reach the treasure trove of the Evil Twins, but are chased out by Spyro the Dragon. Tropy also has a cameo appearance in the "Silhouette Quiz" minigame in Crash Boom Bang!

Other characters
Polar
Polar is Crash Bandicoot's pet bear cub. He lets Crash ride him in Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, helping him through some snow levels and helping him escape from a larger polar bear. There was a secret easter egg in Cortex Strikes Back, in which Crash would continuously bounce on top of him in the second warp room, revealing multiple extra lives. He appears in the opening sequence of Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped as a resident of Crash's home and is a playable character in Crash Team Racing and Crash Nitro Kart. In Crash Team Racing, he is seen in the options screen, reading an upside-down racing manual. He has been hypnotised by N Trance in Crash Nitro Kart.

Nina Cortex
Nina Cortex is the niece of Doctor Neo Cortex. She sometimes aids her uncle in his quest for world domination, though they have had a recent falling-out due to a failed plot headed by her and Cortex's boss Uka Uka. Nina Cortex was originally created by Traveller's Tales as a playable character in Crash Nitro Kart before development duties of the game were transferred to Vicarious Visions. During her conception it was undecided whether she would be Neo Cortex's daughter or niece, hence the deliberate discrepancies regarding her relationship with Cortex in Crash Twinsanity. Her appearance was based on one of the designers working at Traveller's Tales. An early design of her depicted her wearing a white lab coat similar to Neo Cortex's.()

Nina is known to be more ambitious and egotistical than her uncle;() even Aku Aku believes that Nina is "a lot smarter than Cortex ever could be."() Despite her self-admittedly antisocial demeanor,() she is said to have a love for animals.() Nina's most distinguishing features are her spring-loaded steel bionic hands, which were given to her by her uncle Doctor Cortex.(  Nina stands about four feet and eleven inches (1.5 meters) and weighs 110 pounds (50 kilograms).()

When Nina Cortex started to show signs of a kind heart, Doctor Cortex modified her arms with bionic parts and enrolled her in Madame Amberly's Private Academy, which he himself attended as a child. She doesn't see her uncle again until the Evil Twins threaten the existence of the N. Sanity Island in Crash Twinsanity, during which Doctor Cortex sneaks her out of the school to assist him in defeating the Evil Twins. When Crash, Cortex and Nina travel to the Tenth Dimension, Nina is kidnapped by the feral Evil Crash and taken to his house for a tea party, where Cortex soon rescues Nina.() She later helps in defeating the Evil Twins by destroying the power sources of their Deathbot.

In Crash of the Titans, when Cortex fails to dispose of Crash Bandicoot, Nina is called upon by Uka Uka to replace her uncle as the main antagonist of the story. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, Nina attempts to take over Cortex's plot on her own accord when she realizes that she's merely a henchman. When Crash confronts her inside the Doominator, Nina boards her giant Arachnina Titan and battles Crash, only to lose. When the Doominator is disabled, she is rescued from the falling contraption by Doctor Cortex, who reveals that he is proud that she betrayed him,() but proceeds to drop her off at his public school as punishment for doing so, as seen in Crash: Mind over Mutant. When she is eventually visited by Crash and Aku Aku, she angrily accuses Crash of ruining her life and refuses to help them stop Cortex's ongoing plot. When Crash and Aku Aku get desperate, she forces the two to kiss each other and save her science fair project.() She then uses the said project to determine the location of Crunch and Brio, who are at the Sludge's Junkyard.()

In Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage and Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy, Nina is recruited by Doctor Cortex to kidnap Coco Bandicoot and the Professor.() When Spyro and Crash arrive to save Coco and the Professor, Nina chases down Crash, only to soon be captured in a cage. Nina is a playable character in Crash Tag Team Racing, in which she aids Doctor Cortex and N. Gin in trying to take over Von Clutch's MotorWorld.

Reception
Nina's introduction in Crash Twinsanity was met with a positive response among critics. James B. Pringle of IGN said that Nina "almost steals the show with her sassy skip and her Commando-like extension arm" and admitted that he "actually wouldn't mind seeing more of Nina in the future."() Nick Valentino of GameZone praised her as "an inventive character", a "very welcome addition to the series" and "one of the many highlights this game has to offer". He also compared her bionic arms to Bionic Commando.()

Ripper Roo
Ripper Roo is a boss character in the first and second games in the series. He is a kangaroo who was mutated by Doctor Neo Cortex and now has a demented personality (emptily wide-open eyes, hanging tongue, bound to a straitjacket) and distinctive laughter. He mainly attacks through the use of his razor-sharp toenails and laying down TNT and Nitro tiles. As of the second game, he has a second personality that is much more sane than his dominant one; however, an explosion is enough to get him back to his old, hopping mad self. He has additional appearances in "Crash Team Racing" as a boss character and "Crash Bash" as an obstacle. In "Crash Twinsanity", he appears with the rest of Dr. Cortex's minions just before Crash starts battling against Dr. Cortex. Ripper Roo is voiced by Suzuki in the Japanese version of "Crash Team Racing". His laugh was taken from a hyena laughing in and the Tramp; the laugh was voiced by McKennon.

After being thwarted in this plan, he fled back to his native Gasmoxia and only returned to racing after years of seclusion and therapy.() He subsequently appears in Crash Bash as the final boss of the game's story mode.

Tawna
Tawna was the former girlfriend of Crash Bandicoot. She made her debut on the first Crash Bandicoot game, being trapped for observation on Neo Cortex's castle after being experimented on. Crash then invades Cortex's castle, defeats him and saves her. The marketing director of Universal Interactive Studios objected to Tawna's initial design on "basic sexist principles".() The director's behavior concerning the issue unnerved the president of Universal Interactive so much that he requested Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin to change the character to the director's specifications. The incident proved to be such an unpleasant experience that Tawna was omitted from future Crash Bandicoot titles.() Tawna would later make cameos in Crash Bandicoot 3 and Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, at a photo on Crash's house; in Twinsanity, at the sign of Cortex-owned nightclub Moulin Cortex; and at a poster on Crash's house in Mind over Mutant.

Bearminator
The Bearminator is a bear who appears in Bash as the second boss. He is the captain of a small submarine that fires cannonballs and mechanical polar bear cubs, which are armed with missiles on their backs. It is sometimes believed that the Bearminator appeared first in Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, since he looks very similar to the polar bears that chase Crash in some levels in that game. He may have also appeared in Crash Team Racing as a large bear frozen in ice on the racetrack, Polar Pass.

In Twinsanity they act as the main antagonists. The Twins leave their dimension in order to get their revenge on Cortex and destroy the Wumpa Islands. However, with the use of the Psychetron, Crash Bandicoot, Neo Cortex and Nina Cortex travel to the Tenth Dimension in order to stop the Twins' plans. They attack the trio with a mech, but fail. They flee, but are eaten by Crash Bandicoot's Tenth-Dimensional counterpart, Evil Crash, soon after.

Victor is the most serious and sinister-looking of the duo, while Moritz serves as the duo's relief, and is seen constantly asking for food. Their names derive from the fictional scientist Victor Moritz, a character of Whale's 1931 film Frankenstein.

After being mistaken for a barber by her,() he has a  emotional breakdown and decides to get his revenge for the constant verbal abuse he suffered from her during his student days, and, with the use of his raygun, destroys the iron cables attached to Amberley's back, making her plummet into a green toxic substance.
